## Overview
Much like the classic game Galaga, this is a top down space shooter! It has a few original added twists though. The player has the ability to barrel roll to dodge incoming enemies and bullets. There's a few different types of enemies to watch out for! Last but not least, there is a fairly simple point system so players can compare scores. 

## Purpose
Mainly this simple game was developed to learn and practice skills in the Unity game engine. Although, it turned out to be quite a nice browser game!
